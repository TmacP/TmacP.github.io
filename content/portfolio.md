## University of Saskatchewan Cyber Security Team

This project involved redesigning 
the University of Saskatchewan Cyber Security Team's website to be more modern and attractive. 
The site is a simple way for people to learn about the team and its members, as well as to contact them 
or link to their Discord or Instagram.
