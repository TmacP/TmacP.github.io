## Sacrilege

If I have to listen to one more person arguing about which text editor is better, or why some programming language is inferior, I will seriously consider becoming a plumber. At least I doubt I will have to suffer any arguments about which type of toilet is better at flushing excrement; which will be a relief after having to listen to so much of it.

## Vanilla

But seriously, I'm aghast at how badly some educated, intelligent people entirely miss the point. The value of the work you do isn't defined by the tools you use to do it.  
I am going to come out and say it: In my own work I'm using HTML, CSS, and JS.

## Value

The real reason to program a computer is to solve a problem that adds value for someone. Before even opening an IDE, one ought to know what that value is and whom it is going to enrich. In the context of serving small business and identifying ways to add value for them, through the medium of the web, one should remember it is a human activity. Creating a novel design that exudes empathy requires a level of creativity that machines aren't capable of.

## Simplicity

In doing this work, what I value is simplicity. I don't want to waste precious time learning passing fads. I believe in investing in skills and tools that will compound over time. To do this requires longevity, which I'm not convinced most tech is capable of. The basic web has proven capable of evolving, so I'll use it.

## Freedom

I value freedom from framework dependence and vendor lock-in. When considering the longevity of tech, I think about its relevance not just in one year, but in five, ten, or even fifty years. Staying simple and relying on fundamental web technologies gives me the freedom to build something lasting and truly valuable.

## Conclusion

Embracing simplicity in web development is not just about eschewing unnecessary complexity; it's about focusing on what truly mattersâ€”creating value. By leveraging basic web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we can build solutions that are not only effective but also sustainable in the long term. This approach frees us from the constraints of ever-changing frameworks and dependencies, allowing us to invest in skills that will remain relevant and valuable for years to come. So, the next time you're faced with the decision of which tool or technology to use, remember that simplicity can often lead to the most elegant and enduring solutions.
