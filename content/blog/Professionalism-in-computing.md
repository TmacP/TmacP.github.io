if high concequence

if put in place then form of market exclusion

 deprived of useful technology

separate domain by consequence social medial, gaming, regulator mush anticipate



criminal civil penalties (after the fact)
regulation (playing catch up, anticipating)
proff licensing (cost innovation higher cost)
proff regulation (even not legally required maybe useful if you thought of yourself)


imagine if 2006 before mark zuk he couldn't do it at all because not licensed

p1 some is high consequence not all is
p2 word done my amateurs
