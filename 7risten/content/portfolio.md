<h2>University of Saskatchewan Cyber Security Team</h2>
<p>
    This project involved redesigning the University of Saskatchewan Cyber Security Team's website to be more modern and attractive. 
    The site is a simple way for people to learn about the team and its members, as well as to contact them or link to their Discord or Instagram.
