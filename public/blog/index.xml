      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;sacrilege&#34;&gt;Sacrilege&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If I have to listen to one more person arguing about which text editor is better, or why some programming language is inferior (yes, I actually like JavaScript), I will seriously consider becoming a plumber. At least I doubt I will have to suffer any arguments about which brand of toilet is better at flushing excrement; that would be a welcome relief after having to listen to so much of it. But seriously, I&amp;rsquo;m aghast at how badly some educated, intelligent people entirely miss the point of devoting themselves to software development professionally. The value of the work you do isn&amp;rsquo;t defined by the tools you use but rather by the utility you add to the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
