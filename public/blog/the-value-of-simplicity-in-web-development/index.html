        <h1>The Duty of Simplicity</h1>
        <p>2024-06-18</p>
        <h2 id="sacrilege">Sacrilege</h2>
<p>If I have to listen to one more person arguing about which text editor is better, or why some programming language is inferior, I will seriously consider becoming a plumber. At least I doubt I will have to suffer any arguments about which type of toilet is better at flushing excrement; which will be a relief after having to listen to so much of it. But seriously, I&rsquo;m aghast at how badly some educated, intelligent people entirely miss the point of developing software. The value of the work you do isn&rsquo;t defined by the tools you use to do it but rather the utility one adds to the world.</p>
<h2 id="utility">Utility</h2>
<p>The real reason to program a computer is to solve a problem that adds value for someone. Before even opening an IDE, one ought to know what that value is and whom it is going to enrich. It is a human activity. Empathy requires a level of creativity that machines aren&rsquo;t capable of.</p>
<h2 id="duty">Duty</h2>
<p>In doing this work, what I value is simplicity. I don&rsquo;t want to waste precious time learning passing fads. I believe in investing in skills and tools that will compound over time. To do this requires longevity, which I&rsquo;m not convinced most tech is capable of.</p>
<h2 id="heading"></h2>
<p>I value freedom from framework dependence and vendor lock-in. When considering the longevity of tech, I think about its relevance not just in one year, but in five, ten, or even fifty years. Staying simple and relying on fundamental web technologies gives me the freedom to build something lasting and truly valuable.</p>
