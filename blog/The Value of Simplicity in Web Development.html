            <section>
                <h2>Sacrilege</h2>
                <p>
                    If I have to listen to one more person arguing about which text editor is better, 
                    or why some programming language is inferior, 
                    or how people who use ChatGPT to program are somehow not real programmers, 
                    I will seriously consider becoming a plumber. 
                    At least I doubt I will have to suffer any arguments about which type of toilet is 
                    better at flushing excrement; which will be a relief after having to listen to so much of it.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Vanilla</h2>
                <p>
                    But seriously, I'm aghast at how badly some educated, intelligent people entirely miss the point. 
                    The work you do has almost no relation to the tools you use to do it. 
                    I am going to come out and say it: 
                    I'm using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS.
                    No frameworks, Static Site Generators, or Content Management Systems.
                </p>
            
                <h2>Value</h2>
                <p>
                    The real reason to program a computer is to solve a problem that adds value to someone. 
                    Before even opening an IDE, one ought to know what that value is and whom it is going to enrich.
                    In the context of providing small business brochure static sites, 
                    it is clear that the work needed is really not possible for a computer to do alone.
                    Communicating with a business and identifying ways to add value for them, 
                    through the medium of the web, is a human activity.
                    Creating a novel design that exudes empathy requires a level of creativity 
                    that machines aren't capable of.
                </p>
                
                <h2>Simplicity</h2>
                <p>
                    In doing this work, what I value is simplicity.
                    I don't want to waste precious time learning passing fads.
                    I believe in investing in skills and tools that will compound over time.
                    To do this requires longevity, which I'm not convinced most tech is capable of.
                    The basic web has proven capable of evolving, so I'll use it.
                </p>
            
                <h2>Freedom</h2>
                <p>
                    I value freedom from framework dependence and vendor lock-in. 
                    When considering the longevity of tech, I think about its relevance not just in one year, 
                    but in five, ten, or even fifty years. 
                    Staying simple and relying on fundamental web technologies gives me the freedom 
                    to build something lasting and truly valuable.
