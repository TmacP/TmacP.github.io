                <h2>Self Esteem</h2>
                <p>
                    There is an air of sanctimony in Computer Science academia. 
                    Mentioning, to students or professors, 
                    that one wishes to be a web developer is seen as an invitation 
                    to launch into the most tired diatribes about how 
                    REAL software engineers use VIM and UNDERSTAND 
                    the systems they develop on at a low level, unlike web devs.
                </p>
        

                <h2>Professor of What?</h2>
                <p>
                    On one occasion, I was meeting with a professor when 
                    I mentioned I was planning on being a web developer. 
                    I was then rewarded with listening to an hour-long monologue, 
                    clearly rehearsed many times, about how students are 
                    like car drivers who only operate but don’t know how to build a car, 
                    as opposed to mechanics. <br><br>

                    Of course, when I looked at his personal site, 
                    it was basic HTML without even CSS.

        
                <h2>Student of What?</h2>
                <p>
                    On another occasion, I was doing some web design work for a group. 
                    After working all day pro bono, 
                    I submitted a draft design to get some feedback. 
                    One of the students said we could ask the student design club to help. 
                    So, clearly, designers are worth so little they will 
                    just jump at the opportunity to work for free if we ask.

                    And clearly, the work I’d done wasn’t worth acknowledging since 
                    design is worthless compared to development. <br><br>

                    On occasion, I had the opportunity to look at this developer’s 
                    personal website. Of course, it was a default WordPress template.
                </p>
        
                <h2>Understanding</h2>
                <p>
                    The divide between low level and web developers/designers in Computer Science 
                    academia highlights a broader issue of respect and recognition. 
                    Both roles are essential, and undermining one in favor of 
                    the other does a disservice to the field as a whole.
